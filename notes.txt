Stuff to remember to fix:
	* Check functions that return objects by argument reference ( func(ref T t) { t=something;} )
		Some cast away refs and objects stay null :(
	* Remove unnecessery refs
	* Possible unsigned types and subtraction op errors, sigh
	* Plenty of uninitialised class members
	* calculateSize()
